# simple_chatbot_using_nlp

We have created a context based chatbot. We have used intents.json to save the tags, patterns and responses. 
Also we have used keras sequential model for training purpose.

Step 1: Install all necessary libraries.
        tensorflow==2.3.1
        nltk==3.5
        pandas==1.2.3
        numpy==1.18.5
        scikit_learn==0.23.2
        Flask==1.1.2

Step 2: Then install NLTK packages using "nltk.download('all')"

Step 3: Once everything is installed, run chatbot.py code to train the model.
